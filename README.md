# Coffee Machine

This is the first app I created using the Android Studio and Java.

# Inspiration

I always love coffee and wanted to learn how to make capuchino, latte, matcha, ... manually using the semi-auto coffee maker. I needed something to record my coffee-making trials (how much sugar, how I steam the milk,...) to 
create a perfect cup of coffee.
