# Coffee Machine

This is the first app I created using the Android Studio and Java.

# Inspiration

I always love coffee and wanted to learn how to make capuchino, latte, matcha, ... manually using the semi-auto coffee maker. I needed something to record my coffee-making trials (how much sugar, how I steam the milk,..., and how my final product looked like) to 
create a great receipt that I could use to recreate a perfect cup of coffee anytime.

# Lession Learned
 - Android Studio
 - Recycle View
 - Card View
 - Intents
 - Camera user permission

# Want to use or upgrade it
 - Download Android Studio
 - git clone https://github.com/mKimp/coffeeMachine.git
 - Connect the real device to run the app (since we need the camera to take the real pic). The emulator has a very limited capacity.
